# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore uploaded files in development
node_modules

# Ignore dist (build files)
dist/*.js
dist/*.map
dist/__test__/*.js
dist/__test__/*.map

# tmpfile
*.swp
